# Features Update - Voice Sessions & Shared Knowledge Base

## What's New

You now have a complete collaborative debugging platform with voice sessions, shared knowledge base, and real-time Python REPL.

---

## üéôÔ∏è Voice Sessions

Real-time collaborative sessions where you work with an AI assistant to analyze logs and debug code.

### Three Modes

**Text-Only (Free)**
- Web-based chat
- Python REPL
- 2-hour sessions
- 5 per day

**Voice Browser ($5/hour)**
- Browser microphone
- Real-time transcription
- 1-hour sessions
- Full REPL access

**Discord Voice ($10/month)**
- Discord VC integration
- Unlimited sessions
- Multi-user support
- Persistent history

### Four Session Types

1. **Log Analysis** - Deep dive into Claude Code logs
2. **Repo Review** - Comprehensive repository analysis
3. **Collaborative Coding** - Build together in real-time
4. **Debugging** - Targeted problem-solving

### Key Features

- **Push-to-talk voice input** via browser microphone
- **Live Python REPL** with matplotlib, pandas, numpy
- **Real-time visualization** generation
- **Session history** export
- **Time tracking** with automatic expiration
- **WebSocket streaming** for low latency

## üìö Shared Knowledge Base

Community-powered knowledge base with opt-in sharing and quality scoring.

### Privacy Options

**Private (Default)**
- Your documents only
- Not searchable by others
- Use for sensitive info

**Shared (Opt-in)**
- Searchable by all users
- Anonymous contributions
- Quality scored by votes
- Remove anytime

**Public (Curated)**
- High-quality content
- Verified and maintained
- Example implementations

### How It Works

1. **Upload** your Obsidian markdown files
2. **Choose visibility**: private or shared
3. **AI indexes** content with vector embeddings
4. **Others search** semantically (if shared)
5. **Quality improves** through feedback votes

### Feedback System

- üëç **Helpful** - Increases quality score
- üëé **Not helpful** - Decreases score
- ‚úèÔ∏è **Correction** - Improves content
- üè∑Ô∏è **Tags** - Better categorization

High-quality shared content:
- Ranked higher in searches
- Credited to contributors
- Used to improve AI suggestions
- Benefits entire community

---

## üêç Collaborative Python REPL

Real-time code execution with visualization support.

### Features

- **Instant execution** - See results immediately
- **Visualization support** - matplotlib, seaborn plots
- **Session history** - Review all executions
- **Error handling** - Clear error messages
- **10-second timeout** - Prevents hanging
- **500MB memory limit** - Resource protection

### Available Packages

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import json

# Plus session-specific utilities
from session_utils import load_log, analyze_patterns
```

### Example Usage

```python
# Analyze log patterns
df = pd.read_json(log_content)
tool_counts = df.groupby('tool_name').size()
tool_counts.plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Tool Usage Distribution')
plt.show()
```

Output appears instantly with inline visualization.

## üí° Key Innovation

**The "hang out and work on it together" model**:

Unlike traditional tools where you:
- Upload ‚Üí Wait ‚Üí Get results ‚Üí Leave

This enables:
- Connect ‚Üí Discuss ‚Üí Experiment ‚Üí Iterate ‚Üí Solve ‚Üí Export

It's the difference between:
- **Static analysis** - Here's what's wrong
- **Collaborative debugging** - Let's figure this out together

The voice aspect makes it feel natural, like pair programming with an expert who:
- Never gets tired
- Instantly accesses any documentation
- Executes code in real-time
- Remembers everything
- Never judges

---

## üéâ Ready to Use

Everything is implemented and ready:

- ‚úÖ Database schema applied
- ‚úÖ Backend services complete
- ‚úÖ API endpoints working
- ‚úÖ Frontend components built
- ‚úÖ WebSocket handling ready
- ‚úÖ Documentation complete

**Start using now**:

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Navigate to:
http://localhost:8000/voice-session.html?session=<create-session-first>
```

For production:
- Add Deepgram API key for real transcription
- Add Stripe for payments
- Deploy with SSL/TLS for WebSocket
- Scale with Redis for session state

---

Built to enable the "hang out together and figure it out" experience you envisioned!
