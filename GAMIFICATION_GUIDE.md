# Gamification System - Level Up Your Debugging

## Overview

The platform now includes a full RPG-style progression system with mysterious scoring, achievements, quests, and a Top 10 leaderboard.

## The Mysterious Score

Your score is calculated using a secret algorithm that considers:

- **Session completions** - Finish what you start
- **KB contributions** - Share knowledge with the community
- **Insights discovered** - High-signal analysis
- **Successful builds** - Make repos actually work
- **Voice session hours** - Deep collaborative work
- **REPL executions** - Hands-on debugging
- **??? bonus multipliers** - The path reveals itself

The exact formula is intentionally mysterious. Experiment and discover what works!

## Leaderboard
