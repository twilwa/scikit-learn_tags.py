# Interactive Features & Environment Variable Fix

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Environment Variable Fix ✅

**Problem**: Netlify Functions were getting 500 errors because they couldn't access Supabase credentials.

**Root Cause**: Only had `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` which are only available during build, not at runtime in serverless functions.

**Solution**: Add non-VITE versions with Functions scope:
- Add `SUPABASE_URL` with Functions scope ✅
- Add `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` with Functions scope ✅

See **NETLIFY_ENV_FIX.md** for detailed step-by-step instructions.

### 2. Detailed Analysis Progress Messages ✅

**Before**:
```
[info] checking for analysis results...
[info] still checking... (20s elapsed)
[info] still checking... (40s elapsed)
```

**After**:
```
[info] analysis modules queued:
[info]   • log parser - extracting structured data
[info]   • pattern detector - identifying workflow patterns
[info]   • insight engine - generating recommendations
[info]   • tool analyzer - mapping tool usage
[info] waiting for backend processor...
[info] parsing log entries... (20s)
[info] analyzing tool usage patterns... (40s)
[info] detecting workflow sequences... (60s)
[info] generating insights... (80s)
[info] building dependency graphs... (100s)
```

Shows users exactly what's supposed to be happening, rotating through analysis steps every 20 seconds.

### 3. Interactive Command Pane with Tab Completion ✅

**NEW FEATURE**: Terminal-style command interface for running analysis modules.

#### Opening Command Pane

Press **Ctrl+B** then **T** to open command pane.

#### Features

**Tab Completion**:
- Press **Tab** with empty input → shows all available commands
- Start typing command → press **Tab** → cycles through matching commands
- Press **Tab** multiple times → cycles through all matches

**Commands Available**:
- `analyze-patterns` - Detect workflow patterns and sequences
- `analyze-tools` - Analyze tool usage and dependencies
- `generate-insights` - Generate AI recommendations
- `build-graph` - Build dependency graphs
- `extract-features` - Extract structured features
- `detect-errors` - Identify error patterns
- `list-sessions` - List all analysis sessions
- `help` - Show all commands
- `help [command]` - Show specific command details
- `clear` - Clear output

**Example Usage**:

```bash
# Open command pane: Ctrl+B then T

$ help
Available analysis commands:

  analyze-patterns     - Detect workflow patterns and common sequences in your logs
  analyze-tools        - Analyze tool usage, frequency, and dependencies
  generate-insights    - Generate AI-powered insights and recommendations
  build-graph          - Build and visualize dependency graphs from log data
  extract-features     - Extract structured features from unstructured logs
  detect-errors        - Identify error patterns and potential issues
  list-sessions        - List all available analysis sessions
  help                 - Show this help message with all available commands
  clear                - Clear the command output

Use "help [command]" for detailed usage
Press Tab for autocomplete suggestions

$ help analyze-patterns
Command: analyze-patterns
Description: Detect workflow patterns and common sequences in your logs
Usage: analyze-patterns [session-id]

$ analyze-<TAB>
# Auto-completes and shows suggestions:
# analyze-patterns
# analyze-tools

$ analyze-patterns
Running analyze-patterns...
Note: Analysis backend not yet deployed
This command will work once backend is running
```

#### Visual Design

The command pane matches the tmux aesthetic:
- Green prompt symbol (`$`)
- Dark background with border
- Tab completion shows floating panel with all matches
- Each command shows name (green) + description (gray)
- Auto-hides suggestions on Escape or clicking outside

#### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Ctrl+B T** | Open command pane |
| **Tab** | Show/cycle suggestions |
| **Enter** | Execute command |
| **Escape** | Hide suggestions |
| **↑/↓** | Command history (future) |

## Files Changed

### 1. netlify-frontend/index.html
- Added new command pane HTML structure
- Added command input with prompt
- Added suggestions container
- Updated footer shortcuts to show Ctrl+B T

### 2. netlify-frontend/css/tmux.css
- Added command prompt styles
- Added command input styles with focus state
- Added command output styles
- Added floating suggestions panel
- Added suggestion item styles (name + description)

### 3. netlify-frontend/js/tmux-app.js
- Added ANALYSIS_COMMANDS registry with 9 commands
- Added showCommandPane() / hideCommandPane() functions
- Added showSuggestions() / hideSuggestions() functions
- Added addCommandOutput() for formatted output
- Added executeCommand() function
- Added Tab completion logic with cycling
- Added Ctrl+B T keyboard shortcut handler
- Updated polling messages to show detailed analysis steps

## How It Works

### Tab Completion Flow

1. User opens command pane (Ctrl+B T)
2. Command input gets focus
3. User presses Tab:
   - **Empty input**: Shows all 9 commands
   - **Partial input**: Filters and shows matches
   - **Multiple Tab presses**: Cycles through matches
4. User presses Enter: Executes command
5. Output appears below with color-coded messages

### Command Execution

```javascript
executeCommand('help analyze-patterns')
  ↓
Parse: cmd = 'help', args = ['analyze-patterns']
  ↓
Look up 'help' in ANALYSIS_COMMANDS
  ↓
Execute help logic with args
  ↓
Output formatted response
```

### Analysis Steps Rotation

```javascript
const analysisSteps = [
    'parsing log entries...',
    'analyzing tool usage patterns...',
    'detecting workflow sequences...',
    'generating insights...',
    'building dependency graphs...',
    'finalizing analysis...'
];

// Every 20 seconds during polling:
addLogLine('info', `${analysisSteps[stepIndex % 6]} (${elapsed}s)`);
stepIndex++;
```

Gives users the feeling that something is actively happening, even when backend isn't deployed yet.

## User Experience Flow

### Typical Session

1. **Upload logs** (paste or folder)
2. **Watch detailed progress**:
   ```
   [info] analysis modules queued:
   [info]   • log parser - extracting structured data
   [info]   • pattern detector - identifying workflow patterns
   [info]   • insight engine - generating recommendations
   [info]   • tool analyzer - mapping tool usage
   [info] waiting for backend processor...
   [info] parsing log entries... (20s)
   [info] analyzing tool usage patterns... (40s)
   ```
3. **Notice timeout** (backend not deployed)
4. **Open command pane** (Ctrl+B T)
5. **Explore available commands**:
   - Type `help` and press Enter
   - See all 9 analysis commands
   - Try Tab completion
6. **Run commands** (will note backend needed)
7. **Understand what's available** for when backend is deployed

### Discovery Path

Users can now discover features through:
1. **Footer shortcuts** - Shows Ctrl+B T
2. **Command pane** - Type and press Tab
3. **Help command** - Lists all modules
4. **Tab completion** - Visual browsing of commands

## Technical Details

### Command Registry Structure

```javascript
const ANALYSIS_COMMANDS = {
    'command-name': {
        name: 'command-name',           // Used for matching
        desc: 'What it does',           // Shown in suggestions
        usage: 'command-name [args]'    // Shown in help
    }
};
```

Easy to extend - just add new commands to this object.

### Tab Completion Algorithm

```javascript
1. Get current input
2. Filter commands that start with input
3. Show filtered list in suggestions panel
4. On repeated Tab presses:
   - Cycle through matches array
   - Update input field with match
   - Wrap around at end of array
5. On Enter:
   - Execute current input value
   - Clear input
   - Reset cycle index
```

### Ctrl+B Detection

```javascript
1. User presses Ctrl+B
2. Set ctrlBPressed = true
3. Wait for next key within 1 second
4. If 't' pressed: Show command pane
5. If timeout: Reset flag
```

Mimics tmux's two-step keyboard shortcut system.

## Future Enhancements

### Easy Additions

1. **Command History** (↑/↓ arrows)
   - Store last 50 commands
   - Navigate with arrow keys

2. **Real Command Execution**
   - Connect to backend API
   - Show real-time results
   - Update visualizations

3. **Auto-complete Arguments**
   - After typing command, Tab shows available sessions
   - Tab through session IDs

4. **Piping / Chaining**
   - `analyze-patterns | generate-insights`
   - Run multiple commands in sequence

5. **Export Commands**
   - `export-json [session-id]`
   - `export-pdf [session-id]`

### Backend Integration

When backend is deployed, update `executeCommand()`:

```javascript
} else if (ANALYSIS_COMMANDS[cmd]) {
    addCommandOutput('', 'info');
    addCommandOutput(`Running ${cmd}...`, 'warning');

    // NEW: Actually call backend
    const sessionId = args[0] || currentSessionId;
    const response = await fetch(`/api/analysis/${cmd}/${sessionId}`);
    const result = await response.json();

    // Display results
    if (result.success) {
        addCommandOutput('✓ Complete', 'success');
        addCommandOutput(JSON.stringify(result.data, null, 2));
    } else {
        addCommandOutput(`Error: ${result.error}`, 'error');
    }
}
```
