# Repo Graph Planning Project
Code samples for research and development

This repository contains code samples and patterns for building a comprehensive repo graph planning system, including:

## Components

### 1. Repo Synthesis (OpenHands Pattern)
- Repository analysis and synthesis utilities
- Code structure understanding and generation

### 2. Multi-Agent Loops (AutoGPT Pattern)  
- Agent coordination and communication
- Task delegation and result aggregation

### 3. Modular Components & TDD Codegen (Pythagora Pattern)
- Test-driven development workflows
- Modular component architecture

### 4. DAG Node Execution Configs (Dagster Pattern)
- Pipeline configuration and orchestration
- Node-based execution planning

### 5. Config-based Modular ML (HuggingFace TRL Pattern)
- Training orchestration and configuration
- Modular ML pipeline components

### 6. Feature Extraction & Vectorization
- Data processing and feature engineering
- Vector space operations and similarity

### 7. Ontology to API Mapping (sklearn/_tags.py Pattern)
- Metadata system and tag management
- API capability discovery and mapping

### 8. Structured NLP Capability Trees (spaCy Pattern)
- Language processing capability hierarchies
- Component dependency management

### 9. Interface & Model Implementation (HF/Transformers Pattern)
- Abstract base classes and implementations
- Plugin architecture patterns

### 10. Test Plugin Customization (pytest/pluggy Pattern)
- Testing framework extensions
- Plugin system architecture
