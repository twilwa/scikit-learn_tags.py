# Claude Code Log Analyzer

hey. u stuck? lemme take a look.

A minimalist, terminal-style web application that analyzes Claude Code session logs to provide insights, visualizations, and next-step recommendations.

## Features

- Drag-and-drop log file upload (.codex, .claude, or .log files)
- Real-time analysis with WebSocket updates
- Automatic secret redaction for security
- Multiple parallel analysis pipelines:
  - AST analysis of referenced code files
  - Dependency graph generation
  - Tool usage patterns
  - Code complexity metrics
- AI-generated insights prioritized by signal strength
- Interactive 2D network visualizations
- Async commenting on insights
- Optional encrypted analysis in TEE

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Supabase account (database is pre-configured)
- Node.js (optional, for frontend development)

### Installation

1. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-backend.txt
```

2. Environment setup:
The `.env` file should already have your Supabase credentials configured.

3. Run the server:
```bash
python -m backend.main
```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`

## Usage

1. Drop your Claude Code log file (.codex or .claude) into the upload zone, or paste log content
2. Optionally enable encryption for sensitive sessions
3. Click "analyze â†’" to start
4. Watch real-time progress as analysis completes
5. Review insights and visualizations as they appear
6. Add comments to specific insights if desired

## Architecture

### Backend

- **FastAPI** web framework with WebSocket support
- **Supabase** for data persistence (sessions, analysis results, insights)
- **Analysis Service** runs parallel Python-based code analysis tasks
- **Insight Generator** creates prioritized recommendations from analysis
- **Secret Redaction** utility removes sensitive data before processing

### Frontend

- **HTMX** for reactive UI without heavy JavaScript
- **Terminal aesthetic** with dark theme and monospace fonts
- **Vis.js** for network graph visualizations
- **WebSocket** client for real-time updates

### Database Schema

- `sessions` - log upload sessions with status tracking
- `analysis_results` - output from parallel analysis tasks
- `insights` - AI-generated recommendations with signal scores
- `user_comments` - async feedback on insights

## Analysis Pipeline

1. **Log Parsing**: Extract tool calls, file operations, referenced files
2. **Secret Redaction**: Remove API keys, tokens, passwords
3. **Parallel Analysis**:
   - Tool call patterns
   - AST analysis of code structure
   - Dependency graph generation
   - Complexity scoring
4. **Insight Generation**: Create 2-3 sentence recommendations
5. **Signal Scoring**: Prioritize insights by relevance and confidence
6. **Real-time Streaming**: Push results as they complete

## Future Enhancements

- 3D interactive codebase graphs with Three.js
- Desktop application with continuous folder watching
- LLM-driven prompt optimization with DSPy
- Stripe integration for cost tracking
- GitHub issue integration
- SSH access to analysis containers
- Downloadable encrypted reports

## Cost Model

- First 10 users: free tier
- Usage tracking with $1 threshold before billing prompt
- Serverless execution cost + 20% margin
- Modal or E2B for isolated Python execution

## Development

Run in development mode:
```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

btw, i can open these in a TEE if you want. all your secrets are redacted. we won't keep them either way.
